# Create a sibling VM on AWS and make it an encalve

## About

This is a sample python script which is supposed to be launched from an AWS
instance. It creates a 'sibling' instance in the same availability zone and
the same network as the main VM, isolates the instance with iptables and launch
a sample echo server (borrowed from https://realpython.com/python-sockets/) on
port 8080.
